        👨🏽‍💻 a passionate full-stack developer with over a decade of experience

        🎵 music has been a driving force in my life since day one. When I'm not
        coding, you'll often find me lost in the world of melodies, rhythm, and
        harmony. Music is more than a hobby; it's a profound source of
        inspiration and creativity that fuels my work as a developer.

        🕹️ gaming is another realm I adore. As a hobbyist game developer, I get
        to combine my technical skills with my love for gaming. I believe that
        game development is not just about creating experiences but also
        exploring the art of storytelling through interactive mediums.
